I'm passionate about entertainment, specifically film and music, and investing. Tech is disrupting entertainment and creating different channels for distribution and consumption. Music and film have been a big part of my life . I would love to invest in disruptive, entertainment focused tech companies.

My passion for technology helps me strive to make tasks easier for myself and others. I would like to streamline processes by advancing my skills in coding, creating new apps and enhance disability features in these apps and websites. I want to create features that integrate voiceover, Siri and other descriptive features. I believe there has to be some way to have descriptive audio for movies automated similar to adding a close caption track.

I'm interested in what technology can do for me. I have a passion for photography but going blind puts limits on my abilities. Technology us made it so I don't have to have the perfect eye.

My top three interests within technology are: Database Administrator because it allows to manage a company or corporationâ€™s data. Telecommunications: This type of technology makes information transmission easier linking people around the world. Finally, I am passionate about computing because it has become imperative in the working domain everywhere.

"I'm passionate about making the life of others easier through Technology. I love how you can make something amazing from scratch with very little tools, an idea, and a small device"

Software developer, artificial intelligence and data science

I've always been passionate about studying the universe and space travel. I'm a fan of star trek, and I hope that society can reach such fantastic heights as in the show. Technology is the only way to achieve that . I'm interested in artificial intelligence, computational science, and robotics. I would love to make a contribution in at least one of those areas some day.

"Going into college, I did not intend to study Computer Science. Thus, technology allows me to experience how it is to discover and be passionate about a new area. It assists me in broadening my horizons and to approach problems from both a structured and analytical perspective as well as giving room to be creative when looking at real-life issues. Software engineering, is probably most closely related to my current courses. I want to learn more about cybersecurity and data science, but as of now my experience in these areas is limited. "
